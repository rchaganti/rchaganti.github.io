      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every other week, we see a new framework claiming to simplify AI agent development. Thanks to the growing interest in agentic AI. Earlier this year, Google released its framework for developing agents, which it called the Agent Development Kit (ADK).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;youtube-embed&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; margin: 1.5rem auto;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;iframe&#xA;      src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zgrOwow_uTQ&#34;&#xA;      style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 0.5rem;&#34;&#xA;      frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&#xA;      allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34;&#xA;      allowfullscreen&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@bo-yang-svl&#34;&gt;Bo Yang&lt;/a&gt;, tech lead of the ADK project, wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/google-cloud/adk-insider-adk-when-it-was-born-06af442eb1ed&#34;&gt;how ADK was born&lt;/a&gt; and described how 100 lines of code became the most sought-after agent development framework. It is fascinating to read how ADK evolved into what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building AI Agents with Microsoft Agent Framework and Microsoft Foundry: A Complete Guide</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)&lt;/strong&gt; is an open-source development kit that combines the best ideas from Semantic Kernel and AutoGen projects. It provides a flexible foundation for building AI agents that can:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Process user inputs using Large Language Models (LLMs)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Call tools and MCP servers to perform actions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Generate intelligent, context-aware responses.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Manage conversation state across interactions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore five examples that showcase different capabilities of Foundry agents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Foundry Agents</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Foundry (formerly Azure AI Foundry) is a unified system for building intelligent agents. It is a platform that provides models, tools, frameworks, and capabilities such as observability, guardrails, and enterprise-ready governance for building AI agents. With the Foundry Agent service, developers can develop agents locally and deploy them to different environments seamlessly, leveraging the building blocks provided by Microsoft Foundry. Foundry Agent service provides the runtime that manages conversations, orchestrates tool calls, and integrates with identify and observability systems. As discussed in the previous article, agents use LLMs to reason and make decisions. Agents use tools to perform actions. Agents can participate in workflows or interact with other agents to achieve a bigger goal. This is achieved by treating agents as composable units.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introduction to Microsoft Agent Framework</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been following the Microsoft ecosystem for agent and agentic workflow development and have evaluated frameworks such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/microsoft/autogen&#34;&gt;AutoGen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel&#34;&gt;Semantic Kernel&lt;/a&gt;. In the past, I have written &lt;a href=&#34;https://ravichaganti.com/categories/autogen/&#34;&gt;briefly about AutoGen&lt;/a&gt;. I used Semantic Kernel, along with Azure AI Foundry, to experiment with a few enterprise-ready agentic scenarios. Both frameworks are useful in their own ways, and Semantic Kernel, with its enterprise-deployment readiness, became the go-to framework for many. Microsoft &lt;a href=&#34;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/introducing-microsoft-agent-framework-the-open-source-engine-for-agentic-ai-apps/&#34;&gt;announced plans to converge these frameworks&lt;/a&gt; into what it calls the Microsoft Agent Framework, which brings together the best parts of AutoGen and Semantic Kernel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building a Model Context Protocol server for Azure</title>
      <link>https://ravichaganti.com/blog/building-a-model-context-protocol-server-for-azure/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://ravichaganti.com/blog/anthropic-model-context-protocol/&#34;&gt;earlier article&lt;/a&gt; in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://ravichaganti.com/series/mcp/&#34;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; introduced Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s Model Context Protocol. It presented an example of building a simple MCP server for use with the Claude desktop application. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rchaganti/mcp-servers/tree/main/hello-world&#34;&gt;hello-world example&lt;/a&gt; was a very basic implementation of an MCP server. In today&amp;rsquo;s article, we shall extend our knowledge of creating MCP servers to achieve more practical applications. We will build an MCP server to interact with Microsoft Azure resources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic made bootstrap MCP server development easy by providing the &lt;code&gt;create-mcp-server&lt;/code&gt; package. To get started, you need to install this locally as a tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Model Context Protocol by Anthropic for connecting AI models to data</title>
      <link>https://ravichaganti.com/blog/anthropic-model-context-protocol/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, Anthropic introduced and open-sourced the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol&#34;&gt;Model Context Protocol&lt;/a&gt; (MCP). MCP is the new standard for connecting AI models to external data sources and APIs more easily and consistently. With the advances in AI, models are becoming increasingly powerful in reasoning and quality. However, as text-completion machines, these models still lack access to real-time data. AI providers have worked around this using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool calling. Every data source requires custom implementation, and every provider has a way of integrating tools with AI models. MCP addresses these silos by providing a universal, open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
