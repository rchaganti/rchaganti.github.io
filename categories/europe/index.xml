      <description>&lt;p&gt;I returned home from PowerShell Conference EU this morning. Wow, what an amazing event was that! Seriously, right from the opening event to each and every session, this was truly the global PowerShell conference with attendees from more than twelve countries and speakers from four continents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had two sessions at this conference and these were very well received. I uploaded the slides and demo scripts to a PSConfEU &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/psconfeu/2016&#34;&gt;Github repository&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to use them as needed. For those who prefer, Slideshare instead, here are the slide decks. The sessions recordings should be online in a couple of weeks. I will updated this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
