      <description>&lt;p&gt;To start my journey towards learning cloud native technologies, I watched several videos, read a bunch of articles, and spoke to several people. Each of these sources gave me good insights into what is a cloud native application, its characteristics, and different cloud native architectural patterns. However, to put it all together, I tried applying the knowledge to a traditional monolith application and converted it to a cloud native application. And, today&amp;rsquo;s article is about that approach. This approach helped me build a solid foundation. This is how I wanted to learn and this is how I like to describe cloud native applications to others seeking that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
