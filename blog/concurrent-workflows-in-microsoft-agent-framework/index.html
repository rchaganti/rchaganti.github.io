While sequential workflows are powerful for pipeline-style processing, they have a limitation: speed. When agents don\\u0026rsquo;t depend on each other\\u0026rsquo;s output, running them one at a time is inefficient.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s where the concurrent workflow pattern comes into play. This pattern allows multiple agents to work in parallel, dramatically reducing total execution time and enabling scenarios that require diverse perspectives to be analyzed simultaneously.\\nIn this article, we\\u0026rsquo;ll build up from a simple example to a sophisticated multi-analyst system that gathers insights from different perspectives and synthesizes them into a unified executive summary.\\nThe concurrent pattern is useful in scenarios such as:\\nIndependent analysis: Multiple agents can analyze the same input without needing each other\\u0026rsquo;s results. Time-sensitive operations: You need results fast, and parallelism can speed things up. Diverse perspectives: You want varied viewpoints on the same topic (technical, business, ethical, and so on). Redundancy/voting: Multiple agents tackle the same problem, and you aggregate their answers. Let us explore this further using an example. In this example, we will create three analyst agents that analyze a topic across three facets: technical, business, and ethical.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 from agent_framework import ( ConcurrentBuilder, WorkflowOutputEvent, ExecutorInvokedEvent, ExecutorCompletedEvent, WorkflowStatusEvent, WorkflowRunState, ) from agent_framework.azure import AzureOpenAIChatClient from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential import asyncio from dotenv import load_dotenv load_dotenv() # Create chat client chat_client = AzureOpenAIChatClient( credential=DefaultAzureCredential(), ) # Create three specialized analyst agents technical_analyst = chat_client.create_agent( name=\\u0026#34;TechnicalAnalyst\\u0026#34;, instructions=\\u0026#34;Analyze the topic from a technical/engineering perspective.

ConcurrentBuilder creates a workflow that runs all participants in parallel. All three agents receive the same input: Analyze the impact of autonomous vehicles. They execute simultaneously, returning results as they complete.\\nThe ConcurrentBuilder is a fluent builder pattern for constructing concurrent workflows:\\n1 2 3 4 5 workflow = ( ConcurrentBuilder() .participants([agent1, agent2, agent3]) # Agents to run in parallel .build() # Finalize and return the workflow ) Unlike SequentialBuilder, where agents run one after another, passing output forward, ConcurrentBuilder fans out the input to all participants simultaneously.\\nWith the help of events, we can track the progress of the agents as they complete.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 $ python concurrent.py Running concurrent analysis with 3 analysts... ============================================================ ⚡ Starting: TechnicalAnalyst ⚡ Starting: BusinessAnalyst ⚡ Starting: EthicalAnalyst ✓ Completed: BusinessAnalyst ✓ Completed: TechnicalAnalyst ✓ Completed: EthicalAnalyst .... ✅ Workflow completed! So far, we have received individual responses from each agent. But what if we want to combine their insights into a unified summary? This is where aggregators come in.\\nWe can extend this workflow by adding an aggregator. It would be nice if another agent could take the response from the parallel workflow and summarize it for us.\\nBuilding a custom aggregator function An aggregator is an async function that receives all agent responses and produces a combined output.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 from agent_framework import AgentExecutorResponse, ChatMessage, Role # Create a summarizer agent to synthesize results summarizer = chat_client.create_agent( name=\\u0026#34;Summarizer\\u0026#34;, instructions=\\u0026#34;\\u0026#34;\\u0026#34;You are an expert synthesizer.

Once all are complete, the results are passed to aggregate_with_summarizer. The summarizer creates a unified executive summary. The summary becomes the final WorkflowOutputEvent.data Here is the complete working example.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 from agent_framework import ( ConcurrentBuilder, AgentExecutorResponse, ChatMessage, Role, WorkflowOutputEvent, ExecutorInvokedEvent, ExecutorCompletedEvent, WorkflowStatusEvent, WorkflowRunState, ) from agent_framework.azure import AzureOpenAIChatClient from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential import asyncio from dotenv import load_dotenv load_dotenv() # Create chat client chat_client = AzureOpenAIChatClient( credential=DefaultAzureCredential(), ) # Create agents with different perspectives technical_analyst = chat_client.create_agent( name=\\u0026#34;TechnicalAnalyst\\u0026#34;, instructions=\\u0026#34;Analyze the topic from a technical/engineering perspective.

Consider the following for designing a meaningful aggregator.\\nWhat insights should be preserved from each agent? How should conflicts between perspectives be handled? What format does the final output need to be in? Agents in a concurrent workflow may complete at different speeds. The concurrent workflow waits for all to finish before aggregating. If you need partial results, consider using the events to track individual completions.\\nIn the next article, we\\u0026rsquo;ll explore the handoff workflow pattern, in which agents can dynamically transfer control to each other based on the conversation context. This is perfect for scenarios like customer support, where a coordinator routes requests to specialized agents. Stay tuned!\\n\"",

      <p>In the [previous article](<a href="https://ravichaganti.com/blog/sequential-workflows-in-microsoft-agent-framework/">Sequential workflows in Microsoft Agent Framework | Ravikanth Chaganti</a>), we explored the sequential workflow pattern, a straightforward approach where agents process tasks one after another in a defined order. While sequential workflows are powerful for pipeline-style processing, they have a limitation: speed. When agents don&rsquo;t depend on each other&rsquo;s output, running them one at a time is inefficient.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where the concurrent workflow pattern comes into play. This pattern allows multiple agents to work in parallel, dramatically reducing total execution time and enabling scenarios that require diverse perspectives to be analyzed simultaneously.</p>
<p>In this article, we&rsquo;ll build up from a simple example to a sophisticated multi-analyst system that gathers insights from different perspectives and synthesizes them into a unified executive summary.</p>
<p>The concurrent pattern is useful in scenarios such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Independent analysis: Multiple agents can analyze the same input without needing each other&rsquo;s results.</li>
<li>Time-sensitive operations: You need results fast, and parallelism can speed things up.</li>
<li>Diverse perspectives: You want varied viewpoints on the same topic (technical, business, ethical, and so on).</li>
<li>Redundancy/voting: Multiple agents tackle the same problem, and you aggregate their answers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us explore this further using an example. In this example, we will create three analyst agents that analyze a topic across three facets: technical, business, and ethical.</p>

</div><p>So far, we have received individual responses from each agent. But what if we want to combine their insights into a unified summary? This is where aggregators come in.</p>
<p>We can extend this workflow by adding an aggregator. It would be nice if another agent could take the response from the parallel workflow and summarize it for us.</p>

</div><p>The design of an aggregator is important. Consider the following for designing a meaningful aggregator.</p>
<ul>
<li>What insights should be preserved from each agent?</li>
<li>How should conflicts between perspectives be handled?</li>
<li>What format does the final output need to be in?</li>
</ul>
<p>Agents in a concurrent workflow may complete at different speeds. The concurrent workflow waits for all to finish before aggregating. If you need partial results, consider using the events to track individual completions.</p>
<p>In the next article, we&rsquo;ll explore the handoff workflow pattern, in which agents can dynamically transfer control to each other based on the conversation context. This is perfect for scenarios like customer support, where a coordinator routes requests to specialized agents. Stay tuned!</p>
