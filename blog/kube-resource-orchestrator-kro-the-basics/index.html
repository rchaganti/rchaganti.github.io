Helm does not offer any post-deployment reconciliation support, which is important to ensure any drift in application configuration can be detected and corrected. Companies in the Cloud-native space have been looking at alternatives, and a new open-source project called kro may be that alternative.\\nkro (Kube Resource Orchestrator) is an open-source, Kubernetes-native, and cloud-agnostic package manager for Kubernetes applications. It is a joint effort by Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, the three big cloud giants. Kro allows you to define custom Kubernetes APIs that define a group of Kubernetes resources and the logical operations between those resources. kro uses the Common Expression Language (CEL) expressions to define the logical operations, pass values between objects, and calculate the order in which the objects should be created.\\nSo, what exactly is kro? Let\\u0026rsquo;s explore that. Here is a simplified representation of what kro helps us do.\\nAs mentioned earlier, kro allows us to define a custom API. Users and developers can use this custom API to provision instances of a group of resources represented by the custom API. In this image above, when a user creates an instance of the custom API, they will get an instance of the group of resources containing a Redis cache, Postgres DB, and three web service pods.\\nSo, how do you get started using kro to define and provision custom APIs? First, you have to install kro.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 $ export KRO_VERSION=$(curl -sL \\\\ https://api.github.com/repos/kro-run/kro/releases/latest | \\\\ jq -r \\u0026#39;.tag_name | ltrimstr(\\u0026#34;v\\u0026#34;)\\u0026#39; ) $ helm install kro oci://ghcr.io/kro-run/kro/kro \\\\ --namespace kro \\\\ --create-namespace \\\\ --version=${KRO_VERSION} The helm install command creates a new namespace called kro.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 $ kubectl get all -n kro NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/kro-b667bd485-6lvrt 1/1 Running 2 (36m ago) 4d2h NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE deployment.apps/kro 1/1 1 1 4d2h NAME DESIRED CURRENT READY AGE replicaset.apps/kro-b667bd485 1 1 1 4d2h Once the necessary resources are created, it is time to define a custom API. This custom API is called a ResourceGraphDefinition or rgd.\\nThe following YAML spec is the general schema for a ResourceGraphDefinition.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 apiVersion: kro.run/v1alpha1 kind: ResourceGraphDefinition metadata: name: name-of-the-application spec: schema: # API version of the application apiVersion: v1alpha1 # This is the resource kind for your application kind: Application spec: # This is where you define the properties or configuration options for your application name: string | required=true description=\\u0026#34;Name of the instance\\u0026#34; replicas: integer | default=1 minimum=1 maximum=3 status: #Status fields to add to your application instance status resources: # An array of Kubernetes objects or custom resources such as another rgd that you want to provision For a working example, we will use what is provided in the documentation for now and build something better in a later post.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 apiVersion: kro.run/v1alpha1 kind: ResourceGraphDefinition metadata: name: my-application spec: schema: apiVersion: v1alpha1 kind: Application spec: name: string image: string | default=\\u0026#34;nginx\\u0026#34; ingress: enabled: boolean | default=false status: deploymentConditions: ${deployment.status.conditions} availableReplicas: ${deployment.status.availableReplicas} # Define the resources this API will manage. resources: - id: deployment template: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: ${schema.spec.name} spec: replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: app: ${schema.spec.name} template: metadata: labels: app: ${schema.spec.name} spec: containers: - name: ${schema.spec.name} image: ${schema.spec.image} ports: - containerPort: 80 - id: service template: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: ${schema.spec.name}-service spec: selector: ${deployment.spec.selector.matchLabels} ports: - protocol: TCP port: 80 targetPort: 80 - id: ingress includeWhen: - ${schema.spec.ingress.enabled} template: apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: ${schema.spec.name}-ingress annotations: kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path: /health alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: \\u0026#39;[{\\u0026#34;HTTP\\u0026#34;: 80}]\\u0026#39; alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-group-attributes: stickiness.enabled=true,stickiness.lb_cookie.duration_seconds=60 spec: rules: - http: paths: - path: \\u0026#34;/\\u0026#34; pathType: Prefix backend: service: name: ${service.metadata.name} port: number: 80 In this example, we have a deployment object with an nginx Pod, a ClusterIP service, and an ingress. You can use the interpolation syntax to refer to the values of different spec fields. For example, ${schema.spec.ingress.enabled} gives you the value associated with ingress.enabled from the spec section of the schema.\\nAlthough all three are defined in a sequence, there is a dependency. You want the deployment to be ready before creating the service, and similarly, you want the service to be ready before creating an Ingress. In this example, these dependencies can be identified by referring to other objects. For example, the service resource definition uses selector: ${deployment.spec.selector.matchLabels} in its spec. The ingress resource uses name: ${service.metadata.name} in the spec.rules.paths.backend.service. kro uses these clues to build a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for the resources defined in the rgd. You can provision this custom API using the kubectl apply command.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 $ kubectl apply -f rgd.yaml resourcegraphdefinition.kro.run/my-application created $ kubectl get rgd my-application -owide NAME APIVERSION KIND STATE TOPOLOGICALORDER AGE my-application v1alpha1 Application Active [\\u0026#34;deployment\\u0026#34;,\\u0026#34;service\\u0026#34;,\\u0026#34;ingress\\u0026#34;] 64s If everything goes as expected, you should see the rgd in active state and the topological order in which the resources will be provisioned. kro deploys your custom application API definition as a custom resource.\\n1 2 $ kubectl get Applications No resources found in default namespace. Remember? Application is the value of the Kind field in our example. So, you have a resource named Applications. Alright. To realize the application through the custom API, you need to create an instance of the custom API.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 apiVersion: kro.run/v1alpha1 kind: Application metadata: name: my-application-instance spec: name: my-awesome-app ingress: enabled: true You can provide values of all configurable fields from the resource definition within the spec section of the instance. Once again, you can use kubectl apply command to provision this instance.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 $ kubectl apply -f instance.yaml application.kro.run/my-application-instance created $ k get Applications NAME STATE SYNCED AGE my-application-instance IN_PROGRESS False 5s The state of the custom resource instance will remain in progress until all the resources within the group are created successfully.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 $ kubectl get Applications my-application-instance -owide NAME STATE SYNCED AGE my-application-instance ACTIVE True 3m2s $ kubectl get all | grep my-awesome-app pod/my-awesome-app-9ccb8f99d-62lgx 1/1 Running 0 3m18s pod/my-awesome-app-9ccb8f99d-9989h 1/1 Running 0 3m18s pod/my-awesome-app-9ccb8f99d-zkszm 1/1 Running 0 3m18s service/my-awesome-app-service ClusterIP 10.99.199.102 \\u0026lt;none\\u0026gt; 80/TCP 3m13s deployment.apps/my-awesome-app 3/3 3 3 3m18s replicaset.apps/my-awesome-app-9ccb8f99d 3 3 3 3m18s As you see from this example, kro was able to create our resource graph definition as a custom resource and create an instance of that custom resource while taking care of the dependencies. You can also see the custom fields that are added to the custom resource instance\\u0026rsquo;s status.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 $ kubectl get Applications my-application-instance -o yaml apiVersion: kro.run/v1alpha1 kind: Application metadata: annotations: .... name: my-application-instance namespace: default resourceVersion: \\u0026#34;204024\\u0026#34; uid: fef4985b-33e3-4643-8e7f-a540948331f5 spec: image: nginx ingress: enabled: true name: my-awesome-app status: availableReplicas: 3 conditions: - lastTransitionTime: \\u0026#34;2025-03-13T11:36:12Z\\u0026#34; message: Instance reconciled successfully observedGeneration: 1 reason: ReconciliationSucceeded status: \\u0026#34;True\\u0026#34; type: InstanceSynced deploymentConditions: - lastTransitionTime: \\u0026#34;2025-03-13T11:36:11Z\\u0026#34; lastUpdateTime: \\u0026#34;2025-03-13T11:36:11Z\\u0026#34; message: Deployment has minimum availability. reason: MinimumReplicasAvailable status: \\u0026#34;True\\u0026#34; type: Available - lastTransitionTime: \\u0026#34;2025-03-13T11:36:01Z\\u0026#34; lastUpdateTime: \\u0026#34;2025-03-13T11:36:11Z\\u0026#34; message: ReplicaSet \\u0026#34;my-awesome-app-9ccb8f99d\\u0026#34; has successfully progressed. reason: NewReplicaSetAvailable status: \\u0026#34;True\\u0026#34; type: Progressing state: ACTIVE This is a basic example and we shall look at something more useful that helps understand different aspects of using kro in a future post.\\n\"",

      <p><a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> helps application developers and operators manage Kubernetes applications. It allows you to define, install, and upgrade Kubernetes applications. Helm uses a packaging format called charts, a collection of files describing a related set of Kubernetes resources. Other application packaging solutions, such as <a href="https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/">Kustomize</a>, exist, but nothing comes close to the popularity Helm gained in the Cloud Native space. While Helm is certainly the most popular package manager, it comes with a few limitations. Helm does not offer an efficient dependency management solution. At deployment time, there is no way you can retrieve the dependent resource properties for subsequent resource deployment within the chart. Helm cannot handle custom resource definitions well. We must use <code>values.yaml</code> to supply custom values to the chart and its subcharts. This has no schema validation and, therefore, results in human errors at the time of deployment. Helm does not offer any post-deployment reconciliation support, which is important to ensure any drift in application configuration can be detected and corrected. Companies in the Cloud-native space have been looking at alternatives, and a new open-source project called <code>kro</code> may be that alternative.</p>
<p><a href="https://kro.run/docs/overview/">kro</a> (Kube Resource Orchestrator) is an open-source, Kubernetes-native, and cloud-agnostic package manager for Kubernetes applications. It is a joint effort by Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, the three big cloud giants. Kro allows you to define custom Kubernetes APIs that define a group of Kubernetes resources and the logical operations between those resources. kro uses the Common Expression Language (CEL) expressions to define the logical operations, pass values between objects, and calculate the order in which the objects should be created.</p>
<p>So, what exactly is kro? Let&rsquo;s explore that. Here is a simplified representation of what kro helps us do.</p>
<p><img src="/images/kro.png" alt="/images/kro.png"></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, kro allows us to define a custom API. Users and developers can use this custom API to provision instances of a group of resources represented by the custom API. In this image above, when a user creates an instance of the custom API, they will get an instance of the group of resources containing a Redis cache, Postgres DB, and three web service pods.</p>
<p>So, how do you get started using <code>kro</code> to define and provision custom APIs? First, you have to <a href="https://kro.run/docs/getting-started/Installation">install</a> <code>kro</code>.</p>

</div><p>In this example, we have a deployment object with an nginx <code>Pod</code>, a <code>ClusterIP</code> service, and an ingress. You can use the interpolation syntax to refer to the values of different spec fields. For example, <code>${schema.spec.ingress.enabled}</code> gives you the value associated with <code>ingress.enabled</code> from the spec section of the schema.</p>
<p>Although all three are defined in a sequence, there is a dependency. You want the deployment to be ready before creating the service, and similarly, you want the service to be ready before creating an <code>Ingress</code>. In this example, these dependencies can be identified by referring to other objects. For example, the <code>service</code> resource definition uses <code>selector: ${deployment.spec.selector.matchLabels}</code> in its <code>spec</code>. The <code>ingress</code> resource uses <code>name: ${service.metadata.name}</code> in the <code>spec.rules.paths.backend.service</code>. <code>kro</code> uses these clues to build a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for the resources defined in the <code>rgd</code>. You can provision this custom API using the <code>kubectl apply</code> command.</p>
