# Slides: Global Azure Bootcamp - Azure CLI 2.0

I had the opportunity over the weekend to speak at the Global Azure Bootcamp organized by local Microsoft user groups. This event was held at ABB office in Bangalore and I must say that they have done a splendid job. It was a very well organized event. I had only one session and it was about Azure CLI 2.0 Tips and Tricks. I mentioned earlier that I am using CLI mostly these days to work with Azure resources and in this session I shared some tips and tricks around making it easier to work with Azure resource management using Azure CLI 2.0.
