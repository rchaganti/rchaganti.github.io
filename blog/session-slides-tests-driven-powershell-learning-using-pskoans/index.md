# Slides: BITPro UG Meet - Tests Driven PowerShell Learning using PSKoans

At today&#8217;s Bangalore IT Pro and PowerShell Bangalore User Group (PSBUG) event, I had the opportunity to showcase the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="PSKoans  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/vexx32/PSKoans" target="_blank">PSKoans </a>module by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Joel Sallow (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/vexx32" target="_blank">Joel Sallow</a>. This module has a set of Pester tests that you have to fix as you proceed in your efforts towards mastering PowerShell. 

I have found this method engaging and decided that I must show this to the community.

After this session on PSKoans, I did live coding and streamed it <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="live on Twitch (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/381406666" target="_blank">live on Twitch</a> (and did not realize that it was without audio :((). I fixed a function in my PSWindowsAdminCenter module and added a new function.
