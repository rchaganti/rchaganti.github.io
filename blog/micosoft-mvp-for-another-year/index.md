# Microsoft MVP for another year


July 1st of every year is a hit-refresh or F5 day for most of us in the [Microsoft MVP community](http://mvp.microsoft.com/). This year is no different.

I will be a [Cloud & Data Center Management (CDM) MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4029023?fullName=Ravikanth%20Chaganti) for another year. This is my 12th award and still excited the same as my first year in the MVP award program. The last MVP year (2019-2020) was good with PowerShell Conference Asia moving to India and being super successful with over 230 attendees. For the upcoming MVP year (2020-2021), I have a good number of things lined up on this blog already. You will start seeing those contributions starting this month. I am in the process (very slow) of moving [PowerShell Magazine](https://www.powershellmagazine.com/) as well to a static site so that it becomes easy to maintain and author more articles. Stay tuned for these updates.
