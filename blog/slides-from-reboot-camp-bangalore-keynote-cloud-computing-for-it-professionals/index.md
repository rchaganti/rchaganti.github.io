# Slides: Reboot Camp Bangalore - Cloud Computing for IT Professionals

I had the opportunity to do the keynote at the [Microsoft Reboot Camp Bangalore][1]. This is a community driven event with support from Microsoft. The theme for the event was cloud computing and Microsoft Cloud offerings.

In my keynote, I talked about what cloud computing means to the IT professionals and how they should get ready for the future.
