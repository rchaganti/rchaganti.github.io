{{<img src="/images/getsetgo/banner.png" width="660">}}

In the last two parts of this series, you looked at functions and anonymous functions. Both provide a way to create reusable blocks of code and each having its own purpose and use within Go programming. As learned earlier, Go is not a pure object oriented programming language. But, it does support some aspects of OOP. Methods in Go are one way to implement that "object-orientedness". This is based on the concept that a type in Go language can have methods associated with it.
