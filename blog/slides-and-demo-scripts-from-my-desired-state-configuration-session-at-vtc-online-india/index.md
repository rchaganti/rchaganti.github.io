# Slides: VTC Online - Desired State Configuration

The Microsoft MVP community in India delivered a [Virtual Tech Conference (VTC) online][1] yesterday and I had the opportunity to talk about one my favorite topics in [PowerShell 4.0][2] &#8211; [Desired State Configuration][3]. I used this opportunity to build a [custom DSC resource][4] for managing hosts file using DSC. It was a good learning experience for me. And, I see a lot more possibilities with this. Here are the slides I used for this session:

Remember that the HostsFile resource I built is still not polished and it was written in a few minutes and I have hard-coded a few things such as how we check / build host entries. But, nonetheless, this can serve as a good starting point if you plan to build custom DSC resources.
