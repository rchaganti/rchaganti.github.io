# Slides: PowerShell Conference Asia 2016

Yet another successful conference this year. All kudos to Matt, Milton, Sebastian, and Ben for making this year&#8217;s [PowerShell Conference Asia][1] such a super hit.

I had a great time speaking about [Developing Infrastructure Code for CI & CD][2] and [Using PowerShell DSC with AWS Cloud][3]. I have had the opportunity to do an impromptu session with Deepak & Matt on the release pipeline. Overall, I am really happy with the way all my sessions went through and the response from attendees.
