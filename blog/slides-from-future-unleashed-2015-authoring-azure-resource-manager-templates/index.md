# Slides: Future Unleashed – Authoring ARM Templates

{{<figure src="/images/futureunleashed.jpg">}}

I had a great time at Future Unleashed 2015 talking about [Authoring Azure Resource Manager Templates. ][1]This was a one-day technical event where there were 11 tracks covering different aspects from Cloud to Data to Analytics.

The breakout session setup was a little weird. There were no walls for the breakout session room (or whatever you call it). It was just a big expo hall with 11 tracks spread across like exhibitor booths. All the attendees had to wear a headset to hear the speaker.

This is where my session had happened. It took a few mins for me get adjusted to this but overall, it was a very good experience. My session was very interactive and the attendees showed lot of interest in learning how to build ARM templates. I used a step-by-step approach in my demo to show the ARM template authoring and discussed how to use some artifacts in the ARM template language. A 45-minutes session is certainly not enough to show everything but I certainly hope that my attendees got a good overview of the authoring process.

At some point, this month, we should have the session recording available too. I will post the demo scripts along with the session recording. Meanwhile, if you are looking for some in-depth content around learning ARM template authoring, take a look at [my ARM template series][3].
