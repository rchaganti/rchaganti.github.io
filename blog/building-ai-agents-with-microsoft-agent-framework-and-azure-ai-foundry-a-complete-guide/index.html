  "articleBody": "\"The Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) is an open-source development kit that combines the best ideas from Semantic Kernel and AutoGen projects. It provides a flexible foundation for building AI agents that can:\\nProcess user inputs using Large Language Models (LLMs) Call tools and MCP servers to perform actions Generate intelligent, context-aware responses Manage conversation state across interactions In this guide, we\\u0026rsquo;ll explore five progressively complex examples that showcase different capabilities of Foundry agents.\\nPrerequisites Before diving into the examples, make sure you have:\\nPython 3.10+ installed Azure CLI installed and authenticated (az login) Azure AI Foundry project set up with a deployed model Required packages installed: 1 pip install agent-framework[azure-ai] azure-identity python-dotenv Environment variables configured: 1 2 export AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=\\u0026#34;https://\\u0026lt;your-project\\u0026gt;.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/\\u0026lt;project-id\\u0026gt;\\u0026#34; export AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=\\u0026#34;gpt-4o-mini\\u0026#34; Example 1: Basic Agent (No Environment Variables) Let\\u0026rsquo;s start with the simplest possible agent - one that requires minimal setup and demonstrates the core concepts.\\nThe Code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 import asyncio from agent_framework.azure import AzureAIAgentClient from azure.identity.aio import AzureCliCredential async def main(): async with ( AzureCliCredential() as credential, AzureAIAgentClient( project_endpoint=\\u0026#34;https://ai-engineer-in.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/ai-engineer-in\\u0026#34;, model_deployment_name=\\u0026#34;gpt-5-mini\\u0026#34;, async_credential=credential, agent_name=\\u0026#34;WeatherAgent\\u0026#34;, ).create_agent( instructions=\\u0026#34;You are a weather man. Provide accurate and concise weather information based on user queries.\\u0026#34;, ) as agent, ): result = await agent.run(\\u0026#34;What\\u0026#39;s the weather like in Bengaluru?\\u0026#34;) print(result.text) asyncio.run(main()) Key Concepts Async Context Managers: The code uses Python\\u0026rsquo;s async with statement for proper resource management. Both the credential and agent are managed as async context managers, ensuring proper cleanup.\\nAzureCliCredential: This authenticates using your Azure CLI session - no need to manage API keys in your code or environment variables.\\nAzureAIAgentClient: The main client for creating Foundry agents. It accepts:\\nproject_endpoint: Your Azure AI Foundry project URL model_deployment_name: The deployed model to use async_credential: Your authentication credential agent_name: A human-readable name for your agent Agent Instructions: The instructions parameter defines the agent\\u0026rsquo;s persona and behavior. This is the system prompt that guides how the agent responds.\\nRunning the Agent: The agent.run() method sends a message and returns the complete response.\\nWhy This Matters This example shows that creating a basic AI agent requires just a few lines of code. The framework handles all the complexity of API calls, authentication, and response parsing.\\nExample 2: Streaming Responses For better user experience, especially with longer responses, you often want to stream the output as it\\u0026rsquo;s generated rather than waiting for the complete response.\\nThe Code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 import asyncio from agent_framework.azure import AzureAIAgentClient from azure.identity.aio import AzureCliCredential async def main(): async with ( AzureCliCredential() as credential, AzureAIAgentClient( project_endpoint=\\u0026#34;https://ai-engineer-in.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/ai-engineer-in\\u0026#34;, model_deployment_name=\\u0026#34;gpt-5-mini\\u0026#34;, async_credential=credential, agent_name=\\u0026#34;WeatherAgent\\u0026#34;, ).create_agent( instructions=\\u0026#34;You are a weather man. Provide accurate and concise weather information based on user queries.\\u0026#34;, ) as agent, ): print(\\u0026#34;Agent: \\u0026#34;, end=\\u0026#34;\\u0026#34;, flush=True) async for chunk in agent.run_stream(\\u0026#34;Tell me a short story\\u0026#34;): if chunk.text: print(chunk.text, end=\\u0026#34;\\u0026#34;, flush=True) print() asyncio.run(main()) Key Differences from Example 1 run_stream() vs run(): Instead of waiting for the complete response, run_stream() returns an async iterator that yields chunks as they arrive.\\nChunk Processing: Each chunk may contain text (or may be empty for control messages), so we check if chunk.text before printing.\\nReal-time Output: Using flush=True ensures each chunk appears immediately in the console, creating a typing effect.\\nWhen to Use Streaming Interactive applications: Chat interfaces, command-line tools Long-form content: Stories, explanations, code generation User experience: Provides immediate feedback that the agent is working Example 3: Tool Calling (Function Calling) This is where agents become truly powerful. By giving agents access to tools (functions), they can interact with the real world - fetch data from APIs, perform calculations, or execute any Python code you define.\\nThe Code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 import asyncio from typing import Annotated from agent_framework.azure import AzureAIAgentClient from azure.identity.aio import AzureCliCredential from pydantic import Field from dotenv import load_dotenv import os load_dotenv() def get_weather( location: Annotated[str, Field(description=\\u0026#34;The location to get the weather for.\\u0026#34;)], ) -\\u0026gt; str: import requests import json api_key = os.getenv(\\u0026#34;OPEN_WEATHERMAP_API_KEY\\u0026#34;) base_url = \\u0026#34;http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\\u0026#34; complete_url = f\\u0026#34;{base_url}?q={location}\\u0026amp;appid={api_key}\\u0026amp;units=metric\\u0026#34; response = requests.get(complete_url) data = response.json() if data[\\u0026#34;cod\\u0026#34;] != \\u0026#34;404\\u0026#34;: main_data = data[\\u0026#34;main\\u0026#34;] current_temperature = main_data[\\u0026#34;temp\\u0026#34;] return f\\u0026#34;Temperature: {current_temperature}°C\\u0026#34; else: return \\u0026#34;City not found\\u0026#34; async def main(): async with ( AzureCliCredential() as credential, AzureAIAgentClient(async_credential=credential).create_agent( name=\\u0026#34;WeatherAgent\\u0026#34;, instructions=\\u0026#34;You are a helpful weather assistant.\\u0026#34;, tools=get_weather, store=True ) as agent, ): result = await agent.run(\\u0026#34;Given the current climate in Austin Texas, what should I wear?\\u0026#34;) print(result.text) asyncio.run(main()) Key Concepts Typed Tool Functions: The get_weather function uses Python type annotations with Annotated and Pydantic\\u0026rsquo;s Field to describe parameters. This metadata is automatically converted to the function schema that the LLM understands.\\nTool Registration: Pass your function(s) to the tools parameter when creating the agent. You can pass a single function or a list of functions.\\nAutomatic Tool Selection: The agent automatically decides when to call your tool based on the user\\u0026rsquo;s query. Ask about weather? It calls get_weather. Ask about something else? It uses its built-in knowledge.\\nReal API Integration: This example connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch actual weather data - demonstrating how agents can interact with external services.\\nThe store=True Parameter: This enables conversation persistence on the server side.\\nThe Magic of Tool Calling When you ask \\u0026ldquo;What should I wear in Austin Texas?\\u0026rdquo;, the agent:\\nRecognizes it needs weather information Calls get_weather(\\u0026quot;Austin Texas\\u0026quot;) Receives the temperature data Combines that with its knowledge about clothing to give a contextual recommendation This pattern is fundamental to building agents that can take real actions in the world.\\nExample 4: Code Interpreter What if your agent needs to perform complex calculations or data analysis? The Code Interpreter tool allows agents to write and execute Python code in a sandboxed environment.\\nThe Code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 import asyncio from agent_framework import HostedCodeInterpreterTool from agent_framework.azure import AzureAIAgentClient from azure.identity.aio import AzureCliCredential from dotenv import load_dotenv load_dotenv() async def main(): async with ( AzureCliCredential() as credential, AzureAIAgentClient(async_credential=credential).create_agent( name=\\u0026#34;CodingExecutionAgent\\u0026#34;, instructions=\\u0026#34;You are a helpful assistant that can write and execute Python code.\\u0026#34;, tools=HostedCodeInterpreterTool() ) as agent, ): result = await agent.run(\\u0026#34;Calculate the 100th prime number.\\u0026#34;) print(result.text) asyncio.run(main()) Key Concepts HostedCodeInterpreterTool: A built-in tool that provides a sandboxed Python execution environment hosted in Azure. The agent can write and run code without affecting your local system.\\nComplex Problem Solving: Ask the agent to calculate the 100th prime number, and it will:\\nWrite Python code to find prime numbers Execute the code in the sandbox Return the result (541, by the way!) Safe Execution: The code runs in an isolated environment, so the agent can experiment without risk.\\nUse Cases for Code Interpreter Mathematical calculations: Complex formulas, statistical analysis Data processing: Parsing, transforming, analyzing data Code generation and testing: The agent can write code and verify it works Visualization: Generate charts and graphs (when combined with file handling) Example 5: Persistent Agents In production scenarios, you often want agents that persist across sessions - maintaining their configuration and potentially their conversation history.\\nThe Code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 import asyncio import os from agent_framework import ChatAgent from agent_framework.azure import AzureAIAgentClient from azure.ai.projects.aio import AIProjectClient from azure.ai.projects.models import PromptAgentDefinition from azure.identity.aio import AzureCliCredential from dotenv import load_dotenv load_dotenv() foundry_model = os.environ[\\u0026#34;AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME\\u0026#34;] instruction = \\u0026#34;You are a helpful python programming tutor. Answer questions with code samples and explanation.\\u0026#34; async def main(): async with ( AzureCliCredential() as credential, AIProjectClient( endpoint=os.environ[\\u0026#34;AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT\\u0026#34;], credential=credential ) as project_client, ): # Create a persistent agent created_agent = await project_client.agents.create( name=\\u0026#34;PersistentAgent1\\u0026#34;, definition=PromptAgentDefinition( model=foundry_model, instructions=instruction, ), ) async with ChatAgent( chat_client=AzureAIAgentClient( async_credential=credential, project_client=project_client, agent_id=created_agent.id, ), instructions=\\u0026#34;You are a helpful assistant.\\u0026#34; ) as agent: result = await agent.run(\\u0026#34;Hello!\\u0026#34;) print(result.text) asyncio.run(main()) Key Concepts AIProjectClient: Direct access to the Azure AI Projects API for managing agents at a lower level.\\nPromptAgentDefinition: Defines the agent\\u0026rsquo;s configuration including the model and instructions.\\nAgent Creation vs Agent Usage:\\nproject_client.agents.create() creates a persistent agent in Azure ChatAgent wraps that agent for conversation Agent ID: The created agent has a unique ID (created_agent.id) that you can store and reuse in future sessions.\\nChatAgent Wrapper: Provides a consistent interface for chatting with the persistent agent.\\nPersistent Agent Benefits Reusability: Create once, use many times Management: View and manage agents in the Azure portal Consistency: Same configuration across all sessions Team sharing: Multiple users/applications can use the same agent Comparing the Examples Example Complexity Key Feature Best For Basic Low Simple request/response Quick prototypes, testing Streaming Low Real-time output Interactive applications Tool Calling Medium External API integration Real-world actions Code Interpreter Medium Dynamic code execution Calculations, data analysis Persistent Agent High Server-side persistence Production applications Best Practices 1. Use Async/Await Consistently All Foundry agent operations are async. Embrace this for better performance and scalability.\\n2. Leverage Context Managers The async with pattern ensures proper resource cleanup, preventing connection leaks.\\n3. Design Clear Instructions Your agent\\u0026rsquo;s instructions are crucial. Be specific about:\\nThe agent\\u0026rsquo;s role and expertise The tone and format of responses Any constraints or guidelines 4. Type Your Tool Functions Use type annotations and Pydantic fields for tool parameters. This gives the LLM the context it needs to call your functions correctly.\\n5. Handle Errors Gracefully Wrap your agent calls in try/except blocks for production code. Network issues, rate limits, and API errors should be handled gracefully.\\n6. Consider Streaming for Long Responses If your agent generates long responses, streaming dramatically improves perceived performance.\\nConclusion The Microsoft Agent Framework makes it remarkably easy to build sophisticated AI agents with Azure AI Foundry. Starting from a basic agent that takes just 15 lines of code, you can progressively add capabilities like streaming, tool calling, code interpretation, and persistence.\\nThe key insight is that agents aren\\u0026rsquo;t just chat interfaces - they\\u0026rsquo;re intelligent systems that can reason about problems and take real actions. By giving them tools, you extend their capabilities beyond language into the real world.\\nNext Steps Try the examples: Clone the repository and run each example. Add your own tools: Start with simple functions and build complexity Explore multi-agent patterns: Check out the workflow capabilities for orchestrating multiple agents Build something real: Apply these patterns to your own use cases The future of AI is agentic, and with the Microsoft Agent Framework, you have everything you need to build that future today.\\nResources Microsoft Agent Framework Documentation Azure AI Foundry OpenWeatherMap API (for the tool calling example) \"",

      <p>The <strong>Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)</strong> is an open-source development kit that combines the best ideas from Semantic Kernel and AutoGen projects. It provides a flexible foundation for building AI agents that can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process user inputs using Large Language Models (LLMs)</li>
<li>Call tools and MCP servers to perform actions</li>
<li>Generate intelligent, context-aware responses</li>
<li>Manage conversation state across interactions</li>
</ul>
<p>In this guide, we&rsquo;ll explore five progressively complex examples that showcase different capabilities of Foundry agents.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Async Context Managers</strong>: The code uses Python&rsquo;s <code>async with</code> statement for proper resource management. Both the credential and agent are managed as async context managers, ensuring proper cleanup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AzureCliCredential</strong>: This authenticates using your Azure CLI session - no need to manage API keys in your code or environment variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AzureAIAgentClient</strong>: The main client for creating Foundry agents. It accepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>project_endpoint</code>: Your Azure AI Foundry project URL</li>
<li><code>model_deployment_name</code>: The deployed model to use</li>
<li><code>async_credential</code>: Your authentication credential</li>
<li><code>agent_name</code>: A human-readable name for your agent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Agent Instructions</strong>: The <code>instructions</code> parameter defines the agent&rsquo;s persona and behavior. This is the system prompt that guides how the agent responds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Running the Agent</strong>: The <code>agent.run()</code> method sends a message and returns the complete response.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h3>
<p>This example shows that creating a basic AI agent requires just a few lines of code. The framework handles all the complexity of API calls, authentication, and response parsing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="example-2-streaming-responses">Example 2: Streaming Responses</h2>
<p>For better user experience, especially with longer responses, you often want to stream the output as it&rsquo;s generated rather than waiting for the complete response.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><code>run_stream()</code> vs <code>run()</code></strong>: Instead of waiting for the complete response, <code>run_stream()</code> returns an async iterator that yields chunks as they arrive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chunk Processing</strong>: Each chunk may contain text (or may be empty for control messages), so we check <code>if chunk.text</code> before printing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Real-time Output</strong>: Using <code>flush=True</code> ensures each chunk appears immediately in the console, creating a typing effect.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="when-to-use-streaming">When to Use Streaming</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interactive applications</strong>: Chat interfaces, command-line tools</li>
<li><strong>Long-form content</strong>: Stories, explanations, code generation</li>
<li><strong>User experience</strong>: Provides immediate feedback that the agent is working</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="example-3-tool-calling-function-calling">Example 3: Tool Calling (Function Calling)</h2>
<p>This is where agents become truly powerful. By giving agents access to tools (functions), they can interact with the real world - fetch data from APIs, perform calculations, or execute any Python code you define.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Typed Tool Functions</strong>: The <code>get_weather</code> function uses Python type annotations with <code>Annotated</code> and Pydantic&rsquo;s <code>Field</code> to describe parameters. This metadata is automatically converted to the function schema that the LLM understands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tool Registration</strong>: Pass your function(s) to the <code>tools</code> parameter when creating the agent. You can pass a single function or a list of functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatic Tool Selection</strong>: The agent automatically decides when to call your tool based on the user&rsquo;s query. Ask about weather? It calls <code>get_weather</code>. Ask about something else? It uses its built-in knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Real API Integration</strong>: This example connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch actual weather data - demonstrating how agents can interact with external services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The <code>store=True</code> Parameter</strong>: This enables conversation persistence on the server side.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-magic-of-tool-calling">The Magic of Tool Calling</h3>
<p>When you ask &ldquo;What should I wear in Austin Texas?&rdquo;, the agent:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recognizes it needs weather information</li>
<li>Calls <code>get_weather(&quot;Austin Texas&quot;)</code></li>
<li>Receives the temperature data</li>
<li>Combines that with its knowledge about clothing to give a contextual recommendation</li>
</ol>
<p>This pattern is fundamental to building agents that can take real actions in the world.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="example-4-code-interpreter">Example 4: Code Interpreter</h2>
<p>What if your agent needs to perform complex calculations or data analysis? The Code Interpreter tool allows agents to write and execute Python code in a sandboxed environment.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>HostedCodeInterpreterTool</strong>: A built-in tool that provides a sandboxed Python execution environment hosted in Azure. The agent can write and run code without affecting your local system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Complex Problem Solving</strong>: Ask the agent to calculate the 100th prime number, and it will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write Python code to find prime numbers</li>
<li>Execute the code in the sandbox</li>
<li>Return the result (541, by the way!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Safe Execution</strong>: The code runs in an isolated environment, so the agent can experiment without risk.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="use-cases-for-code-interpreter">Use Cases for Code Interpreter</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mathematical calculations</strong>: Complex formulas, statistical analysis</li>
<li><strong>Data processing</strong>: Parsing, transforming, analyzing data</li>
<li><strong>Code generation and testing</strong>: The agent can write code and verify it works</li>
<li><strong>Visualization</strong>: Generate charts and graphs (when combined with file handling)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example-5-persistent-agents">Example 5: Persistent Agents</h2>
<p>In production scenarios, you often want agents that persist across sessions - maintaining their configuration and potentially their conversation history.</p>

<h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2>
<h3 id="1-use-asyncawait-consistently">1. Use Async/Await Consistently</h3>
<p>All Foundry agent operations are async. Embrace this for better performance and scalability.</p>
<h3 id="2-leverage-context-managers">2. Leverage Context Managers</h3>
<p>The <code>async with</code> pattern ensures proper resource cleanup, preventing connection leaks.</p>
<h3 id="3-design-clear-instructions">3. Design Clear Instructions</h3>
<p>Your agent&rsquo;s instructions are crucial. Be specific about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The agent&rsquo;s role and expertise</li>
<li>The tone and format of responses</li>
<li>Any constraints or guidelines</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-type-your-tool-functions">4. Type Your Tool Functions</h3>
<p>Use type annotations and Pydantic fields for tool parameters. This gives the LLM the context it needs to call your functions correctly.</p>
<h3 id="5-handle-errors-gracefully">5. Handle Errors Gracefully</h3>
<p>Wrap your agent calls in try/except blocks for production code. Network issues, rate limits, and API errors should be handled gracefully.</p>
<h3 id="6-consider-streaming-for-long-responses">6. Consider Streaming for Long Responses</h3>
<p>If your agent generates long responses, streaming dramatically improves perceived performance.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Microsoft Agent Framework makes it remarkably easy to build sophisticated AI agents with Azure AI Foundry. Starting from a basic agent that takes just 15 lines of code, you can progressively add capabilities like streaming, tool calling, code interpretation, and persistence.</p>
<p>The key insight is that agents aren&rsquo;t just chat interfaces - they&rsquo;re intelligent systems that can reason about problems and take real actions. By giving them tools, you extend their capabilities beyond language into the real world.</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Try the examples</strong>: Clone the repository and run each example.</li>
<li><strong>Add your own tools</strong>: Start with simple functions and build complexity</li>
<li><strong>Explore multi-agent patterns</strong>: Check out the workflow capabilities for orchestrating multiple agents</li>
<li><strong>Build something real</strong>: Apply these patterns to your own use cases</li>
</ol>
<p>The future of AI is agentic, and with the Microsoft Agent Framework, you have everything you need to build that future today.</p>
