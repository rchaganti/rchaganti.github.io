# Slides: Azure MVP Bootcamp – Microsoft Azure Cloud and DevOps

I had the privilege to join the [Miracle ][1]team at Visakhapatnam today for an Azure MVP bootcamp. I spoke about [Microsoft Azure Cloud and DevOps][2]. This event, I must say, it a very well organized and orchestrated. I have been to conferences and events in India and outside India and never seen this level of care of speakers and attendees anywhere.

I started my day with a good morning walk along the beach and just loved it. I wish I get to do this often.

Finally, in my session, there were 100+ attendees and it was very interactive. Here are the slides from that session.
