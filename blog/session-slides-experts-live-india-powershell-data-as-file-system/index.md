# Slides: Experts Live India – PowerShell Data as File System

I had the opportunity to speak at the inaugural edition of Experts Live India 2019 over the weekend. It was a great experience. The organizers did a great job even when there were teething facilities issues that plagued the event right from the start.

I had planned only for one session at the event but as some international speakers could not make it to the event, I was asked to take up one more session and I chose to show the audience SHiPS module. Hierarchical data can be read as a file system in PowerShell using SHiPS open source module. In this session, I walked the audience through what are providers and what is the advantage of implementing PowerShel providers using the SHiPS module.

Once again, the slides do not contain great deal of information since I wanted to make this more of a demo based session. The demo scripts are available at <a href="https://github.com/rchaganti/Presentations/tree/master/ExpertsLiveIN2019/PSDataAsFileSystem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/rchaganti/Presentations/tree/master/ExpertsLiveIN2019/PSDataAsFileSystem</a>.
