# Slides: Getting Started with PowerShell scripting

I just came back from the <a href="http://www.ravichaganti.com/psbug" target="_blank">PowerShell</a> / <a href="http://bitpro.in" target="_blank">Bangalore ITPro</a> UG meet. We had nearly 40 people showing up for this event. I spoke about getting started with PowerShell scripting and <a href="http://www.exchangeserverinfo.net" target="_blank">Ismail</a> talked about Exchange 2010 migration. Here are the slides I used for my session.
