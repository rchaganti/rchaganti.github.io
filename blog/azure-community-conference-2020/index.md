[Azure Community Conference](https://www.azconf.dev/) is a 3 day multi-track virtual event scheduled to go live on November 24th 2020. This event is being organized by the [Bangalore Azure User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Azure-Bangalore/). The target audience of this virtual event are cloud and web developers working with open source and cloud native technologies on the Microsoft stack. This event will be a free two conference days that includes a free workshop as well. [Registration for this event](https://www.azconf.dev/#tickets) is open.

This event already has got a super-star line up of speakers including Janakiram MSV, James Montemagno, Dhananjay Kumar, Lars Klint, and Neependra Khare to name just a few. I will be speaking as well on one of my most favorite topics in the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) space. If you want to speak, the [call of papers](https://www.azconf.dev/#cfp) is still open.

Whether you are an expert or still a learner (a life long learner like me), go ahead and register for this event. I am sure there is loads of learning coming our way!
