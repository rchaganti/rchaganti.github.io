# Slides and Demo Scripts: Global Azure Bootcamp 2021 - Azure Bicep


Today I had the opportunity to present live (virtually) at the Global Azure Bootcamp 2021. My session was around [Azure Bicep](https://github.com/azure/bicep). I really enjoyed preparing for and delivering this session.

If you follow me on Twitter or this blog, you know I've started a [new series of articles on Azure Bicep](/series/azure-bicep). These articles are essentially notes from my Bicep learning sessions. There are a few more pending in the next few days, but overall, I really enjoyed learning about Bicep. This series and my session at GAB 2021 helped me share my learning with the community.

I published these slides and demo scripts that I used in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rchaganti/gab2021).
