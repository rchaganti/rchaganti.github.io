# [Book] Azure Bicep - Zero to Hero is complete


Finally! I published the final chapter in my book [Azure Bicep - Zero to Hero](https://leanpub.com/azurebicep) today. I [started this project more than a year ago](https://ravichaganti.com/blog/book-announcing-azure-bicep-zero-to-hero/) with an intention that I will complete it before end of year 2021. However, a few personal life events made me shift focus to my family and that pushed the book timelines to the right. In the last few weeks, I spent good amount of my personal time to explore a few new areas within Bicep and formed the content for the last few chapters.

So far, this book has 40 readers. As promised earlier, I have not taken a single penny from this book revenue for my personal use. All proceeds will go to charity once I hit 100 readers (whatever that amount may be).
