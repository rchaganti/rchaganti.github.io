  "articleBody": "\"In the introduction to Google ADK, we looked at the basics of using ADK to create an agent, connect tools, and also learnt how to define agents using the declarative YAML configuration. The example we implemented used the Agent class. This class is an alias of the LlmAgent class. LlmAgent behavior is non-deterministic as it uses an LLM for deciding what tools to use or how to proceed toward a goal. ADK also offers workflow agents that are more deterministic, control the execution flow of their sub-agents, and operate according to predefined logic. The execution flow of workflow agents depends on their type.\\nIn this article today, we will review different agent types.\\nLlmAgent We have seen a detailed example of using an Agent or LlmAgent in the earlier part of this series. Let us revisit LlmAgent and understand how this agent type deals with sub-agents. To demonstrate this, we will build a code tutor agent with two sub-agents: a code generator and a code reviewer.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent code_generator_agent = LlmAgent( model=\\u0026#39;gemini-2.5-flash\\u0026#39;, name=\\u0026#39;code_generator\\u0026#39;, description=\\u0026#39;Agent that generates code based on user requirements.\\u0026#39;, instruction=\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39; You are a code generator only and NOT a reviewer. Generate code based on the user\\u0026#39;s requirements. Ensure that the code is well-commented and follows best practices. Wrap the code in markdown format for better readability. \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;, ) code_reviewer_agent = LlmAgent( model=\\u0026#39;gemini-2.5-flash\\u0026#39;, name=\\u0026#39;code_reviewer\\u0026#39;, description=\\u0026#39;Agent that reviews code and provides feedback.\\u0026#39;, instruction=\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39; You are a code reviewer. Review the provided code and provide constructive feedback. Suggest improvements and best practices to enhance the code quality. \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;, ) root_agent = LlmAgent( model=\\u0026#39;gemini-2.5-flash\\u0026#39;, name=\\u0026#39;code_tutor\\u0026#39;, description=\\u0026#39;Code tutor agent that can help generate or review code.\\u0026#39;, instruction=\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39; You are an expert code tutor that can help a learner generate or review code in any programming language. For generating code, use only the code_generator_agent. For reviewing code, use only the code_reviewer_agent. Always decide which sub-agent to use based on the user\\u0026#39;s request. \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;, sub_agents = [code_generator_agent, code_reviewer_agent], ) In the preceding example, we have three agents. The code_generator_agent can generate code in any language, the code_reviewer_agent reviews code written in any language, and the code_tutor agent chooses and orchestrates the right agent based on the user prompt.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 (.venv) PS C:\\\\GitHub\\\\google-adk-101\\u0026gt; adk run .\\\\code_tutor\\\\ Running agent code_tutor, type exit to exit. [user]: Write a Hello, World program in Python and review it for any enhancements. [code_generator]: ```python # hello_world.py def greet(): \\u0026#34;\\u0026#34;\\u0026#34; This function prints the classic \\u0026#34;Hello, World!\\u0026#34; message to the console. \\u0026#34;\\u0026#34;\\u0026#34; print(\\u0026#34;Hello, World!\\u0026#34;) if __name__ == \\u0026#34;__main__\\u0026#34;: # Call the greet function when the script is executed directly greet() ``` Now, I will transfer this to the `code_reviewer` agent for any potential enhancements. [code_reviewer]: This is a well-structured and excellent \\u0026#34;Hello, World!\\u0026#34; program in Python! Here\\u0026#39;s a review with some feedback, mostly reinforcing the good practices already in place: **Strengths and Best Practices Observed:** 1. **Function Encapsulation (`greet()`):** You\\u0026#39;ve correctly encapsulated the \\u0026#34;Hello, World!\\u0026#34; logic within a function. This promotes modularity, reusability, and makes the code easier to read and test. 2. **Docstrings:** The `greet()` function includes a clear and concise docstring. This is a best practice for documenting what functions do, which is invaluable for code maintainability and understanding, especially in larger projects. 3. **`if __name__ == \\u0026#34;__main__\\u0026#34;:` Block:** This is a crucial Python best practice. It ensures that the `greet()` function is only called when the script is executed directly (e.g., `python hello_world.py`). If this file were imported as a module into another script, the `greet()` function would not be automatically executed, preventing unintended side effects. 4. **Readability:** The code is very clean, straightforward, and easy to understand. **Potential Enhancements (Minor/General Best Practices):** For this specific \\u0026#34;Hello, World!\\u0026#34; program, your code is already highly optimized and follows best practices. There isn\\u0026#39;t much to \\u0026#34;enhance\\u0026#34; without making it overly complex. However, for future reference in more complex applications, you might consider: 1. **Type Hinting (for more complex functions):** While not applicable here as `greet()` takes no arguments and implicitly returns `None`, for functions that accept parameters or return values, adding type hints can improve code readability, help catch errors during development with static analysis tools (like MyPy), and serve as self-documentation. *Example of type hinting (not for your current `greet` function, but for illustration):* ```python def greet_person(name: str) -\\u0026gt; str: \\u0026#34;\\u0026#34;\\u0026#34; Greets a person by name. \\u0026#34;\\u0026#34;\\u0026#34; return f\\u0026#34;Hello, {name}!\\u0026#34; # print(greet_person(\\u0026#34;Alice\\u0026#34;)) ``` **Conclusion:** Your \\u0026#34;Hello, World!\\u0026#34; program is very well-written, adheres to Pythonic best practices, and is a perfect example for its purpose. Great job! [user]: Given the prompt, the code_tutor agent first transfers control to the code_generator_agent, then to the code_reviewer_agent, for review of the generated code for any improvements. The code_tutor agent is still non-deterministic because it uses an LLM to choose which agent to transfer to.\\nWorkflow agents Another category of agents that ADK offers is the workflow agents. Workflow agents offer a deterministic execution flow. In the earlier example, an LlmAgent orchestrated the workflow based on the prompt. Workflow agents use a predefined logic to orchestrate the sub-agents. With this type of agent, an LLM is not needed to determine the execution order; rather, the agent\\u0026rsquo;s type determines the execution flow.\\nThere are three types of workflow agents.\\nSequential Agent As the name suggests, this type of agent executes sub-agents in a sequence, in the order they are specified. Let us look at an example.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, SequentialAgent code_generator_agent = LlmAgent( model=\\u0026#39;gemini-2.5-flash\\u0026#39;, name=\\u0026#39;code_generator\\u0026#39;, description=\\u0026#39;Agent that generates code based on user requirements.\\u0026#39;, instruction=\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39; You are a code generator only and NOT a reviewer. Generate code based on the user\\u0026#39;s requirements. Ensure that the code is well-commented and follows best practices. Wrap the code in markdown format for better readability. \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;, ) code_reviewer_agent = LlmAgent( model=\\u0026#39;gemini-2.5-flash\\u0026#39;, name=\\u0026#39;code_reviewer\\u0026#39;, description=\\u0026#39;Agent that reviews code and provides feedback.\\u0026#39;, instruction=\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39; You are a code reviewer. Review the provided code and provide constructive feedback. Suggest improvements and best practices to enhance the code quality. \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;, ) root_agent = SequentialAgent( name=\\u0026#39;code_tutor\\u0026#39;, description=\\u0026#39;Code tutor agent that can help generate or review code.\\u0026#39;, sub_agents = [code_generator_agent, code_reviewer_agent], ) This sequential agent is similar to the previous example. It is a code tutor. In the previous example, a sub-agent was chosen based on the user prompt. Depending on the prompt, either or both agents get executed. With a sequential agent, both agents are executed in the order specified in the sub_agents list.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 (.venv) PS C:\\\\GitHub\\\\google-adk-101\\u0026gt; adk run .\\\\code_tutor\\\\ Running agent code_tutor, type exit to exit. [user]: Write a Hello, World program in Python. [code_generator]: ```python # This is a simple Python program that prints \\u0026#34;Hello, World!\\u0026#34; to the console. def hello_world(): \\u0026#34;\\u0026#34;\\u0026#34; Prints the classic \\u0026#34;Hello, World!\\u0026#34; message. \\u0026#34;\\u0026#34;\\u0026#34; print(\\u0026#34;Hello, World!\\u0026#34;) # The entry point of the program. if __name__ == \\u0026#34;__main__\\u0026#34;: # Call the function to display the message. hello_world() ``` [code_reviewer]: This is a well-written \\u0026#34;Hello, World!\\u0026#34; program that goes beyond the absolute minimum to demonstrate good programming practices. Here\\u0026#39;s a review: **Positive Aspects:** 1. **Readability:** The code is extremely clear, easy to understand, and well-commented. 2. **Function Definition (`hello_world()`):** Encapsulating the print statement within a function is excellent practice. Even for a single line, it promotes modularity and makes the code reusable and testable. 3. **Docstring:** The function includes a clear docstring, which is crucial for explaining the purpose of functions, especially in larger projects. 4. **`if __name__ == \\u0026#34;__main__\\u0026#34;:` block:** This is a fundamental Python best practice. It ensures that the `hello_world()` function is only called when the script is executed directly, not when it\\u0026#39;s imported as a module into another script. This makes your code reusable. 5. **Comments:** The comments explain the purpose of the program and the entry point clearly, which is helpful for beginners or anyone new to the codebase. **Suggestions for Improvement (Minor and Contextual):** For a program of this simplicity, there\\u0026#39;s very little to \\u0026#34;improve\\u0026#34; as it already follows best practices. However, here are some points to consider for more complex scenarios: 1. **Type Hinting (Advanced but good to know):** For functions that take arguments or return values, adding type hints improves code clarity and allows for static analysis tools (like MyPy) to catch potential errors. * *Example (if `hello_world` were to return a string):* ```python def hello_world() -\\u0026gt; str: \\u0026#34;\\u0026#34;\\u0026#34; Returns the classic \\u0026#34;Hello, World!\\u0026#34; message. \\u0026#34;\\u0026#34;\\u0026#34; return \\u0026#34;Hello, World!\\u0026#34; if __name__ == \\u0026#34;__main__\\u0026#34;: message = hello_world() print(message) ``` * For the current `hello_world()` that just prints and implicitly returns `None`, type hints aren\\u0026#39;t strictly necessary but could be added as `def hello_world() -\\u0026gt; None:`. However, for such a simple function, this might be considered overkill by some. 2. **Minimalism vs. Best Practices:** While the current code demonstrates excellent practices, the *absolute most minimal* \\u0026#34;Hello, World!\\u0026#34; would just be `print(\\u0026#34;Hello, World!\\u0026#34;)`. The provided code wisely prioritizes good structure over extreme minimalism, which is commendable. **Conclusion:** This is an excellent example of a \\u0026#34;Hello, World!\\u0026#34; program. It\\u0026#39;s not just functional, but also showcases fundamental Python best practices like modularity, documentation, and proper script execution. Well done! [user]: Sequential agents, any workflow agent for that matter, do not require an LLM, as they simply orchestrate the task using sub-agents in a predefined order.\\nThe second type of workflow agent is a parallel agent.\\nParallel Agent A parallel agent executes its sub-agents concurrently. Let us look at an example to understand this.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent code_generator_agent_g25 = LlmAgent( model=\\u0026#39;gemini-2.5-flash\\u0026#39;, name=\\u0026#39;code_generator_g25\\u0026#39;, description=\\u0026#39;Agent that generates code based on user requirements.\\u0026#39;, instruction=\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39; You are a code generator only and NOT a reviewer. Generate code based on the user\\u0026#39;s requirements. Ensure the code is well commented and follows best practices. Wrap the code in markdown format for better readability. \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;, output_key=\\u0026#39;g25_code\\u0026#39; ) code_generator_agent_g30 = LlmAgent( model=\\u0026#39;gemini-3-flash-preview\\u0026#39;, name=\\u0026#39;code_generator_g30\\u0026#39;, description=\\u0026#39;Agent that generates code based on user requirements.\\u0026#39;, instruction=\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39; You are a code generator only and NOT a reviewer. Generate code based on the user\\u0026#39;s requirements. Ensure that the code is well-commented and follows best practices.

Review and compare the code by the two code generator agents and select the best one. code_generator_agent_g25 output {g25_code}. code_generator_agent_g30 output {g30_code}. Explain the reasons for your selection. \\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;\\u0026#39;, ) root_agent = SequentialAgent( name=\\u0026#39;code_tutor\\u0026#39;, description=\\u0026#39;Code tutor agent that can help generate or review code.\\u0026#39;, sub_agents = [parallel_code_generator, code_reviewer_agent], ) This example uses the parallel agent construct to generate code for the same prompt with two different models. The code_generator_agent_g25 uses Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 3.0 Flash is used by the code_generator_agent_g30 agent.\\nThis example implements output keys to save the agent\\u0026rsquo;s response directly into the session\\u0026rsquo;s state. We will learn more about this later. For now, understand that you can specify the output_key within the LlmAgent definition to specify the key used to retrieve an agent\\u0026rsquo;s response within a session. This example also implements a sequential agent that combines the parallel agent with the code_reviewer_agent to select the best code. The code_reviewer_agent receives the output from the parallel agent and takes an action based on its instructions. The output keys defined in the code generator agents are specified within the reviewer agent\\u0026rsquo;s instructions.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 PS C:\\\\GitHub\\\\google-adk-101\\u0026gt; adk run .\\\\code_tutor\\\\ Running agent code_tutor, type exit to exit.

[code_reviewer]: I will compare the two code submissions and select the better one based on clarity, efficiency, correctness, robustness, and adherence to best practices. ### Review of `code_generator_agent_g25` **Pros:** 1. **Leverages Standard Library:** It correctly identifies and utilizes `math.gcd` for calculating the Greatest Common Divisor. This is a significant advantage as `math.gcd` is highly optimized, reliable, and generally preferred over a custom implementation in production code. 2. **Clear Functionality:** The `lcm` function is concise and correctly implements the formula `LCM(a, b) = |a * b| / GCD(a, b)`, handling the zero case (`LCM(x, 0) = 0`). 3. **Comprehensive Examples:** The `if __name__ == \\u0026#34;__main__\\u0026#34;:` block includes a wide range of example test cases (positive integers, prime numbers, multiples, zero inputs) that clearly demonstrate the function\\u0026#39;s behavior and correctness. This is excellent for testing and understanding. 4. **Robust Error Handling:** The user input section includes `try-except` blocks for `ValueError` (for non-integer input) and a general `Exception` for other unexpected errors. 5. **Good Docstrings and Type Hinting:** Clear docstrings explain the purpose, arguments, and return values, and type hints are used effectively. **Cons:** 1. The `gcd` function is essentially a wrapper around `math.gcd`. While it adds a docstring, it could potentially be omitted, and `math.gcd` called directly within `lcm` to reduce one level of indirection, or its docstring could mention it\\u0026#39;s a wrapper. However, having a dedicated `gcd` function is not a significant drawback. ### Review of `code_generator_agent_g30` **Pros:** 1. **Correct Logic:** Both `calculate_gcd` and `calculate_lcm` functions are logically correct and implement the Euclidean algorithm and the LCM formula accurately. 2. **Good Structure:** It separates the GCD, LCM, and main execution logic into distinct functions (`calculate_gcd`, `calculate_lcm`, `main`). 3. **Robustness for Zero:** Correctly handles the LCM of zero with any number. 4. **Good Docstrings and Type Hinting:** Similar to g25, it uses clear docstrings and type hints. 5. **Error Handling:** Includes a `try-except` block for `ValueError` in user input. **Cons:** 1. **Manual GCD Implementation:** While functionally correct, reimplementing the Euclidean algorithm when `math.gcd` is readily available in the standard library is generally less efficient and less Pythonic. `math.gcd` is implemented in C and is typically faster. 2. **Limited Examples:** The `main` function focuses solely on user input and does not provide pre-defined example test cases. This makes it less immediately illustrative compared to g25\\u0026#39;s comprehensive examples. 3. **Less Comprehensive Error Handling:** Only handles `ValueError` for user input, whereas g25 also catches a broader `Exception`. ### Conclusion Both agents provide valid and correct solutions for calculating the LCM. However, `code_generator_agent_g25` stands out as the superior choice due to the following reasons: 1. **Efficiency and Best Practice (GCD):** `g25` correctly utilizes the `math.gcd` function from Python\\u0026#39;s standard library. This is the recommended approach as it\\u0026#39;s optimized, tested, and reliable. `g30` re-implements the Euclidean algorithm, which, while correct, is unnecessary when a superior built-in option exists. 2. **Demonstrative Examples:** `g25` includes a wide array of test cases in its `if __name__ == \\u0026#34;__main__\\u0026#34;:` block, covering various scenarios including edge cases (like zero inputs). These examples are invaluable for understanding how the function behaves, for verification, and for demonstrating its robustness. `g30` only includes user input, lacking these illustrative examples. 3. **Robust Error Handling:** `g25` includes a more comprehensive error handling block in its `main` function (`except ValueError` and `except Exception`), making it slightly more robust. **The best code is generated by `code_generator_agent_g25`.** [user]: The third type of workflow agent is the loop agent.\\nLoop Agent A loop agent repeatedly runs a sequence of agents for a specified number of iterations or until a stop condition is met.

To make this happen, we need a signal from the reviewer agent. This is done by modifying the instructions given to both the reviewer and refiner agents. When the code refined by the refiner is satisfactory, the reviewer will respond with a completion word or phrase. In this example, it is APPROVED. When the refiner agent receives a response from the reviewer that contains only the completion word or phrase, it will call the specified tool to terminate the loop. Within this function, tool_context.actions.escalate = True indicates that the control be escalated to a higher-level agent and tool_context.actions.skip_summarization = True indicates that there is no need to call the LLM to summarize the reviewer agent\\u0026rsquo;s response.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 PS C:\\\\GitHub\\\\google-adk-101\\u0026gt; adk run .\\\\code_tutor\\\\ Running agent code_tutor_agent, type exit to exit.

It correctly handles the base cases (n=0) and negative inputs, as well as non-integer inputs. The `__main__` block provides a robust user interface with input validation and error handling. However, there\\u0026#39;s an opportunity to improve the separation of concerns within the `factorial` function itself. **Feedback and Suggestions for Improvement:** ....

      <p>In the introduction to Google ADK, we looked at the basics of using ADK to create an agent, connect tools, and also learnt how to define agents using the declarative YAML configuration. The example we implemented used the <code>Agent</code> class. This class is an alias of the <code>LlmAgent</code> class. <code>LlmAgent</code> behavior is non-deterministic as it uses an LLM for deciding what tools to use or how to proceed toward a goal. ADK also offers <a href="https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/">workflow agents</a> that are more deterministic, control the execution flow of their sub-agents, and operate according to predefined logic. The execution flow of workflow agents depends on their type.</p>
<p>In this article today, we will review different agent types.</p>
<h2 id="llmagent">LlmAgent</h2>
<p>We have seen a detailed example of using an <code>Agent</code> or <code>LlmAgent</code> in the earlier part of this series. Let us revisit <code>LlmAgent</code> and understand how this agent type deals with sub-agents. To demonstrate this, we will build a code tutor agent with two sub-agents: a code generator and a code reviewer.</p>

</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">**Strengths and Best Practices Observed:**
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">1.  **Function Encapsulation (`greet()`):** You&#39;</span>ve correctly encapsulated the <span class="s2">&#34;Hello, World!&#34;</span> logic within a <span class="k">function</span>. This promotes modularity, reusability, and makes the code easier to <span class="nb">read</span> and test.
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">2.  **Docstrings:** The <span class="sb">`</span>greet<span class="o">()</span><span class="sb">`</span> <span class="k">function</span> includes a clear and concise docstring. This is a best practice <span class="k">for</span> documenting what functions <span class="k">do</span>, which is invaluable <span class="k">for</span> code maintainability and understanding, especially in larger projects.
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">3.  **<span class="sb">`</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&#34;__main__&#34;</span>:<span class="sb">`</span> Block:** This is a crucial Python best practice. It ensures that the <span class="sb">`</span>greet<span class="o">()</span><span class="sb">`</span> <span class="k">function</span> is only called when the script is executed directly <span class="o">(</span>e.g., <span class="sb">`</span>python hello_world.py<span class="sb">`</span><span class="o">)</span>. If this file were imported as a module into another script, the <span class="sb">`</span>greet<span class="o">()</span><span class="sb">`</span> <span class="k">function</span> would not be automatically executed, preventing unintended side effects.

</div><p>Given the prompt, the <code>code_tutor</code> agent first transfers control to the <code>code_generator_agent</code>, then to the <code>code_reviewer_agent</code>, for review of the generated code for any improvements. The <code>code_tutor</code> agent is still non-deterministic because it uses an LLM to choose which agent to transfer to.</p>
<h2 id="workflow-agents">Workflow agents</h2>
<p>Another category of agents that ADK offers is the workflow agents. Workflow agents offer a deterministic execution flow. In the earlier example, an <code>LlmAgent</code> orchestrated the workflow based on the prompt. Workflow agents use a predefined logic to orchestrate the sub-agents. With this type of agent, an LLM is not needed to determine the execution order; rather, the agent&rsquo;s type determines the execution flow.</p>
<p>There are three types of workflow agents.</p>
<h3 id="sequential-agent">Sequential Agent</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, this type of agent executes sub-agents in a sequence, in the order they are specified. Let us look at an example.</p>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">Here<span class="s1">&#39;s a review:
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">**Positive Aspects:**
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">1.  **Readability:** The code is extremely clear, easy to understand, and well-commented.
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">2.  **Function Definition (`hello_world()`):** Encapsulating the print statement within a function is excellent practice. Even for a single line, it promotes modularity and makes the code reusable and testable.
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">3.  **Docstring:** The function includes a clear docstring, which is crucial for explaining the purpose of functions, especially in larger projects.
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">4.  **`if __name__ == &#34;__main__&#34;:` block:** This is a fundamental Python best practice. It ensures that the `hello_world()` function is only called when the script is executed directly, not when it&#39;</span>s imported as a module into another script. This makes your code reusable.        
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">5.  **Comments:** The comments explain the purpose of the program and the entry point clearly, which is helpful <span class="k">for</span> beginners or anyone new to the codebase.
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">**Suggestions <span class="k">for</span> Improvement <span class="o">(</span>Minor and Contextual<span class="o">)</span>:**
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">For a program of this simplicity, there<span class="s1">&#39;s very little to &#34;improve&#34; as it already follows best practices. However, here are some points to consider for more complex scenarios:
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">1.  **Type Hinting (Advanced but good to know):** For functions that take arguments or return values, adding type hints improves code clarity and allows for static analysis tools (like MyPy) to catch potential errors.
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">    *   *Example (if `hello_world` were to return a string):*
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">        ```python
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">        def hello_world() -&gt; str:
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">            &#34;&#34;&#34;
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">            Returns the classic &#34;Hello, World!&#34; message.
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">            &#34;&#34;&#34;
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">            return &#34;Hello, World!&#34;
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">        if __name__ == &#34;__main__&#34;:
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">            message = hello_world()
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">            print(message)
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">        ```
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">    *   For the current `hello_world()` that just prints and implicitly returns `None`, type hints aren&#39;</span>t strictly necessary but could be added as <span class="sb">`</span>def hello_world<span class="o">()</span> -&gt; None:<span class="sb">`</span>. However, <span class="k">for</span> such a simple <span class="k">function</span>, this might be considered overkill by some.
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">2.  **Minimalism vs. Best Practices:** While the current code demonstrates excellent practices, the *absolute most minimal* <span class="s2">&#34;Hello, World!&#34;</span> would just be <span class="sb">`</span>print<span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">&#34;Hello, World!&#34;</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="sb">`</span>. The provided code wisely prioritizes good structure over extreme minimalism, which is commendable.  
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">**Conclusion:**
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">This is an excellent example of a <span class="s2">&#34;Hello, World!&#34;</span> program. It<span class="err">&#39;</span>s not just functional, but also showcases fundamental Python best practices like modularity, documentation, and proper script execution. Well <span class="k">done</span>!

</div><p>This example uses the parallel agent construct to generate code for the same prompt with two different models. The <code>code_generator_agent_g25</code> uses Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 3.0 Flash is used by the <code>code_generator_agent_g30</code> agent.</p>

<p>This example implements output keys to save the agent&rsquo;s response directly into the <a href="https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/state/">session&rsquo;s state</a>. We will learn more about this later. For now, understand that you can specify the <code>output_key</code> within the <code>LlmAgent</code> definition to specify the key used to retrieve an agent&rsquo;s response within a session. This example also implements a sequential agent that combines the parallel agent with the <code>code_reviewer_agent</code> to select the best code. The <code>code_reviewer_agent</code> receives the output from the parallel agent and takes an action based on its instructions. The output keys defined in the code generator agents are specified within the reviewer agent&rsquo;s instructions.</p>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">**Pros:**
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">1.  **Leverages Standard Library:** It correctly identifies and utilizes <span class="sb">`</span>math.gcd<span class="sb">`</span> <span class="k">for</span> calculating the Greatest Common Divisor. This is a significant advantage as <span class="sb">`</span>math.gcd<span class="sb">`</span> is highly optimized, reliable, and generally preferred over a custom implementation in production code.
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">2.  **Clear Functionality:** The <span class="sb">`</span>lcm<span class="sb">`</span> <span class="k">function</span> is concise and correctly implements the formula <span class="sb">`</span>LCM<span class="o">(</span>a, b<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">|</span>a * b<span class="p">|</span> / GCD<span class="o">(</span>a, b<span class="o">)</span><span class="sb">`</span>, handling the zero <span class="k">case</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="sb">`</span>LCM<span class="o">(</span>x, 0<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> 0<span class="sb">`</span><span class="o">)</span>.
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">3.  **Comprehensive Examples:** The <span class="sb">`</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&#34;__main__&#34;</span>:<span class="sb">`</span> block includes a wide range of example <span class="nb">test</span> cases <span class="o">(</span>positive integers, prime numbers, multiples, zero inputs<span class="o">)</span> that clearly demonstrate the <span class="k">function</span><span class="s1">&#39;s behavior and correctness. This is excellent for testing and understanding.
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">4.  **Robust Error Handling:** The user input section includes `try-except` blocks for `ValueError` (for non-integer input) and a general `Exception` for other unexpected errors.
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">5.  **Good Docstrings and Type Hinting:** Clear docstrings explain the purpose, arguments, and return values, and type hints are used effectively.
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">**Cons:**
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">1.  The `gcd` function is essentially a wrapper around `math.gcd`. While it adds a docstring, it could potentially be omitted, and `math.gcd` called directly within `lcm` to reduce one level of indirection, or its docstring could mention it&#39;</span>s a wrapper. However, having a dedicated <span class="sb">`</span>gcd<span class="sb">`</span> <span class="k">function</span> is not a significant drawback.

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1">### Review of `code_generator_agent_g30`</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">**Pros:**
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">1.  **Correct Logic:** Both <span class="sb">`</span>calculate_gcd<span class="sb">`</span> and <span class="sb">`</span>calculate_lcm<span class="sb">`</span> functions are logically correct and implement the Euclidean algorithm and the LCM formula accurately.
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">2.  **Good Structure:** It separates the GCD, LCM, and main execution logic into distinct functions <span class="o">(</span><span class="sb">`</span>calculate_gcd<span class="sb">`</span>, <span class="sb">`</span>calculate_lcm<span class="sb">`</span>, <span class="sb">`</span>main<span class="sb">`</span><span class="o">)</span>.
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">3.  **Robustness <span class="k">for</span> Zero:** Correctly handles the LCM of zero with any number.

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">5.  **Error Handling:** Includes a <span class="sb">`</span>try-except<span class="sb">`</span> block <span class="k">for</span> <span class="sb">`</span>ValueError<span class="sb">`</span> in user input.
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">**Cons:**
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">1.  **Manual GCD Implementation:** While functionally correct, reimplementing the Euclidean algorithm when <span class="sb">`</span>math.gcd<span class="sb">`</span> is readily available in the standard library is generally less efficient and less Pythonic. <span class="sb">`</span>math.gcd<span class="sb">`</span> is implemented in C and is typically faster.
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">2.  **Limited Examples:** The <span class="sb">`</span>main<span class="sb">`</span> <span class="k">function</span> focuses solely on user input and does not provide pre-defined example <span class="nb">test</span> cases. This makes it less immediately illustrative compared to g25<span class="s1">&#39;s comprehensive examples.
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">3.  **Less Comprehensive Error Handling:** Only handles `ValueError` for user input, whereas g25 also catches a broader `Exception`.

</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">Both agents provide valid and correct solutions for calculating the LCM. However, `code_generator_agent_g25` stands out as the superior choice due to the following reasons:
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">1.  **Efficiency and Best Practice (GCD):** `g25` correctly utilizes the `math.gcd` function from Python&#39;</span>s standard library. This is the recommended approach as it<span class="err">&#39;</span>s optimized, tested, and reliable. <span class="sb">`</span>g30<span class="sb">`</span> re-implements the Euclidean algorithm, which, <span class="k">while</span> correct, is unnecessary when a superior built-in option exists.
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">2.  **Demonstrative Examples:** <span class="sb">`</span>g25<span class="sb">`</span> includes a wide array of <span class="nb">test</span> cases in its <span class="sb">`</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&#34;__main__&#34;</span>:<span class="sb">`</span> block, covering various scenarios including edge cases <span class="o">(</span>like zero inputs<span class="o">)</span>. These examples are invaluable <span class="k">for</span> understanding how the <span class="k">function</span> behaves, <span class="k">for</span> verification, and <span class="k">for</span> demonstrating its robustness. <span class="sb">`</span>g30<span class="sb">`</span> only includes user input, lacking these illustrative examples.
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">3.  **Robust Error Handling:** <span class="sb">`</span>g25<span class="sb">`</span> includes a more comprehensive error handling block in its <span class="sb">`</span>main<span class="sb">`</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="sb">`</span>except ValueError<span class="sb">`</span> and <span class="sb">`</span>except Exception<span class="sb">`</span><span class="o">)</span>, making it slightly more robust.

<p>In this example, a loop agent is defined to iterate between the review and refine process. The initial code generation is performed by the code_generator_agent, and then the review-refine loop refines the code. This loop runs for maximum iterations as specified by the <code>max_iterations</code> property in the <code>LoopAgent</code> definition.</p>

</div><p>Taking a cue from the ADK documentation, the <code>exit_loop</code> is used to implement loop termination. To make this happen, we need a signal from the reviewer agent. This is done by modifying the instructions given to both the reviewer and refiner agents. When the code refined by the refiner is satisfactory, the reviewer will respond with a completion word or phrase. In this example, it is APPROVED. When the refiner agent receives a response from the reviewer that contains only the completion word or phrase, it will call the specified tool to terminate the loop. Within this function, <code>tool_context.actions.escalate = True</code> indicates that the control be escalated to a higher-level agent and <code>tool_context.actions.skip_summarization = True</code> indicates that there is no need to call the LLM to summarize the reviewer agent&rsquo;s response.</p>
