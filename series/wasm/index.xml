      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://webassembly.org/&#34;&gt;WebAssembly,&lt;/a&gt; a.k.a Wasm, defines a portable binary-code format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm enables developers to write code that runs in web browsers with near-native performance using languages such as C, C++, Rust, Go, and many other modern languages. Wasm is not a replacement for JavaScript but is designed to complement and run alongside JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am still learning about Wasm and looking at opportunities to use Wasm in designing modern and cloud-native applications. My focus has been using the Go programming language for Wasm as well. So, when I started learning Wasm, I quickly looked for ways to create a development environment that would help me in my journey toward mastering Wasm. For this, I started looking at &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers&#34;&gt;VS Code development containers&lt;/a&gt;. This resulted in a set of devcontainer features that I can use within a development container definition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
