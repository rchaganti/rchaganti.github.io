      <description>&lt;p&gt;Containerization is everywhere &amp;ndash; from on-premises data centers to the edge and in the cloud. We have been using containers right from development to production. I wrote about VS Code development containers and how &lt;a href=&#34;https://ravichaganti.com/blog/bicep-feature-in-vscode-devcontainer/&#34;&gt;I have standardized my development environment using devcontainers.&lt;/a&gt; There are several options for companies to run containerized applications in production. we can run individual application containers on a container host using engines like Docker. We can use tools like Docker &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/compose/&#34;&gt;Compose&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/&#34;&gt;Swarm&lt;/a&gt; for slightly complex multi-container, multi-host environments. However, it becomes complex to manage such environments. This needs us to implement a physical or virtualized server environment and handle all operational overhead associated with running our data center.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
