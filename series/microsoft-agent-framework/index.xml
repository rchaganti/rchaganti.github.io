      <title>Handoff workflows in Microsoft Agent Framework</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the previous articles, we explored Sequential and Concurrent workflow patterns in the Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF). Today, we dive into one of the most practical and widely-applicable patterns: the handoff workflow. The handoff pattern models real-world scenarios in which a conversation or task is transferred from one agent to another based on context, expertise, or role. Think of it like a customer support call center—you first speak with a frontline agent who assesses your issue and then routes you to the appropriate specialist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the [previous article](&lt;a href=&#34;https://ravichaganti.com/blog/sequential-workflows-in-microsoft-agent-framework/&#34;&gt;Sequential workflows in Microsoft Agent Framework | Ravikanth Chaganti&lt;/a&gt;), we explored the sequential workflow pattern, a straightforward approach where agents process tasks one after another in a defined order. While sequential workflows are powerful for pipeline-style processing, they have a limitation: speed. When agents don&amp;rsquo;t depend on each other&amp;rsquo;s output, running them one at a time is inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where the concurrent workflow pattern comes into play. This pattern allows multiple agents to work in parallel, dramatically reducing total execution time and enabling scenarios that require diverse perspectives to be analyzed simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A single AI agent is powerful and can do impressive things. But real-world applications often need multiple specialists working together, with each agent handling a specific task before passing results to the next. As with humans, in the agentic world we also need to break complex problems into manageable pieces and have specialized agents handle each task. We need one agent to review another&amp;rsquo;s work and handle complex tool invocation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building persistent AI Agents with Microsoft Agent Framework and Microsoft Foundry</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my earlier post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ravichaganti.com/blog/getting-started-with-foundry-agents/&#34;&gt;Getting Started with Foundry Agents&lt;/a&gt;, I covered the basics of creating agents using the Azure AI Foundry Agents service and the &lt;code&gt;azure-ai-projects&lt;/code&gt; SDK. In another article in this series, we looked at creating Azure AI agents with Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF). Agents created with MAF are local only where MAF acts as the runtime. In this follow-up, we will examine how to create Foundry agents using MAF.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)&lt;/strong&gt; is an open-source development kit that combines the best ideas from Semantic Kernel and AutoGen projects. It provides a flexible foundation for building AI agents that can:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Process user inputs using Large Language Models (LLMs)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Call tools and MCP servers to perform actions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Generate intelligent, context-aware responses.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Manage conversation state across interactions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore different examples that showcase different capabilities of AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introduction to Microsoft Agent Framework</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been following the Microsoft ecosystem for agent and agentic workflow development and have evaluated frameworks such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/microsoft/autogen&#34;&gt;AutoGen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel&#34;&gt;Semantic Kernel&lt;/a&gt;. In the past, I have written &lt;a href=&#34;https://ravichaganti.com/categories/autogen/&#34;&gt;briefly about AutoGen&lt;/a&gt;. I used Semantic Kernel, along with Azure AI Foundry, to experiment with a few enterprise-ready agentic scenarios. Both frameworks are useful in their own ways, and Semantic Kernel, with its enterprise-deployment readiness, became the go-to framework for many. Microsoft &lt;a href=&#34;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/introducing-microsoft-agent-framework-the-open-source-engine-for-agentic-ai-apps/&#34;&gt;announced plans to converge these frameworks&lt;/a&gt; into what it calls the Microsoft Agent Framework, which brings together the best parts of AutoGen and Semantic Kernel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
