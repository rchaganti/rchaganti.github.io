      <title>Adding visitor counter to statically generated web pages</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the to-do list items I had for this static blog site was to figure out a way to add page views counter to every article. This is especially important for PowerShell Magazine articles as we move that to a static site as well. I tried looking for a few solutions but found mostly things that would require playing with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While looking at different GitHub profile pages this morning, I came across a visitor counter on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/TylerLeonhardt&#34;&gt;Tyler&amp;rsquo;s page&lt;/a&gt;. This piqued my interest and looked at how he was generating it. It was made possible through a service hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/&#34;&gt;glitch.me&lt;/a&gt;. There is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jwenjian/visitor-badge&#34;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; that contains the source for this. At first, it seemed like a thing only for GitHub readme markdown but looking at the docs, I realized that I can embed that in simple webpages too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My custom Hugo shortcode collection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past I wrote here about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ravichaganti.com/blog/adding-azdeploy-button-in-static-pages-using-hugo/&#34;&gt;Az Deploy button shortcode&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ravichaganti.com/blog/embedding-channel9-videos-in-hugo-static-pages/&#34;&gt;channel9 video embed shortcode&lt;/a&gt; for Hugo generated static pages. I have been creating some simple shortcodes for my own use on this blog as I start writing on different technologies again. A couple of more shortcodes I added recently are for the ARM template visualize button and launching Azure Cloud Shell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today I decided to publish these &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rchaganti/hugo-shortcodes&#34;&gt;shortcodes as a collection on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of writing about each and every shortcode &amp;ndash; unless it has significant value to others as well &amp;ndash; this article will get updated every time I publish a new shortcode.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GitHub workflow for streamlined publishing of static pages</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I moved to this site/blog to static pages using Hugo and GitHub pages, I have been finding ways to optimize the publishing experience. If you ever used Wordpress, the plugins that are available to customize the site look and feel and functionality will spoil you. They make your life easy by extending base functionality and you can achieve pretty much anything you want as long as there is a plugin for that and you will always find one. Moving from such an environment to a static page generator makes you feel that you have to do all the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Embedding Channel9 Videos in Hugo Static Pages</title>
      <link>https://ravichaganti.com/blog/embedding-channel9-videos-in-hugo-static-pages/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying a few things with my new blogging platform here and in the preparation for a new series of articles, I wanted the ability to embed &lt;a href=&#34;https://channel9.msdn.com/&#34;&gt;Channel9&lt;/a&gt; videos. This is Hugo platform! So, it was not a big deal. I just had to create another &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/&#34;&gt;shortcode&lt;/a&gt; like the one I created for &lt;a href=&#34;https://ravichaganti.com/blog/adding-azdeploy-button-in-static-pages-using-hugo/&#34;&gt;Deploy to Azure button&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is the code for the shortcode.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;gist-embed&#34; style=&#34;margin: 1.5rem 0;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;div id=&#34;1863372959281c6ca3a48d22bef366b1-placeholder&#34; class=&#34;gist-placeholder hidden&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div style=&#34;background: linear-gradient(135deg, #24292e 0%, #2f363d 100%); border: 1px solid #444d56; border-radius: 0.5rem; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &#xA;      &lt;svg style=&#34;width: 4rem; height: 4rem; margin: 0 auto 1rem; opacity: 0.9;&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;#ffffff&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;path d=&#34;M12 0c-6.626 0-12 5.373-12 12 0 5.302 3.438 9.8 8.207 11.387.599.111.793-.261.793-.577v-2.234c-3.338.726-4.033-1.416-4.033-1.416-.546-1.387-1.333-1.756-1.333-1.756-1.089-.745.083-.729.083-.729 1.205.084 1.839 1.237 1.839 1.237 1.07 1.834 2.807 1.304 3.492.997.107-.775.418-1.305.762-1.604-2.665-.305-5.467-1.334-5.467-5.931 0-1.311.469-2.381 1.236-3.221-.124-.303-.535-1.524.117-3.176 0 0 1.008-.322 3.301 1.23.957-.266 1.983-.399 3.003-.404 1.02.005 2.047.138 3.006.404 2.291-1.552 3.297-1.23 3.297-1.23.653 1.653.242 2.874.118 3.176.77.84 1.235 1.911 1.235 3.221 0 4.609-2.807 5.624-5.479 5.921.43.372.823 1.102.823 2.222v3.293c0 .319.192.694.801.576 4.765-1.589 8.199-6.086 8.199-11.386 0-6.627-5.373-12-12-12z&#34;/&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/svg&gt;&#xA;&#xA;      &lt;h4 style=&#34;color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;&#34;&gt;&#xA;        GitHub Gist&#xA;      &lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p style=&#34;color: #c9d1d9; font-size: 0.875rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;&#34;&gt;&#xA;        This code snippet requires your consent to load content from GitHub, which may set cookies.&#xA;      &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hugo shortcode for Deploy to Azure Button in a Static Page</title>
      <link>https://ravichaganti.com/blog/adding-azdeploy-button-in-static-pages-using-hugo/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I moved to this new implementation of the blog using Hugo and GitHub pages, I decided to move older article &lt;a href=&#34;https://ravichaganti.com/series/arm-templates/&#34;&gt;series around authoring Azure Resource Manager templates&lt;/a&gt;. This series was one of the most visited ones on this blog. This series provided an incremental way to learn how to author ARM templates and deploy these ARM templates. In each of these articles, I added a &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-azure-button&#34;&gt;Deploy to Azure Button&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; that you could just click and open the template directly in Azure Portal ready for deployment. The code behind this button usually looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Moved Blog to a Static Site Using Hugo and GitHub Pages</title>

      <description>&lt;figure class=&#34;figure &#34; style=&#34;max-width: 50%; height: 50%; margin: 1.5rem auto;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://ravichaganti.com/images/welcome.jpg&#34; class=&#34;glightbox&#34; data-gallery=&#34;post-images&#34; data-glightbox=&#34;description: &#34; style=&#34;display: block; height: 100%;&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://ravichaganti.com/images/welcome.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 0.5rem; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I wrote something here. I was using a Digital Ocean droplet to run this blog using self-hosted version of Wordpress. Overall, it was good experience but there are issues with Wordpress installs. While it allows greater levels of customization, when all you need is just sharing your ideas, it becomes rather heavy. Also, the recent vulnerabilities made me think about it again. While I was having this thought process, I came across a few sites hosted on GitHub pages using Jekyll and simple static pages. I really wanted to move but moving from Wordpress to static site isn&amp;rsquo;t an easy option. There are Wordpress &lt;a href=&#34;https://ma.ttias.be/step-by-step-guide-migrating-wordpress-to-hugo/&#34;&gt;plugins available to export&lt;/a&gt; to markdown format and then host the same on GitHub pages. This is done using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. While, on paper, it looks very easy job, it is actually not. The exported markdown files won&amp;rsquo;t be compatible with your selected &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo theme&lt;/a&gt;. As I was wondering about this whole process, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ChendrayanV&#34;&gt;Chen&lt;/a&gt; came to the rescue and gave me a head start. After reviewing what he sent and doing some more research, I decided to build the site from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
