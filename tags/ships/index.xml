      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to speak at the inaugural edition of Experts Live India 2019 over the weekend. It was a great experience. The organizers did a great job even when there were teething facilities issues that plagued the event right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had planned only for one session at the event but as some international speakers could not make it to the event, I was asked to take up one more session and I chose to show the audience SHiPS module. Hierarchical data can be read as a file system in PowerShell using SHiPS open source module. In this session, I walked the audience through what are providers and what is the advantage of implementing PowerShel providers using the SHiPS module.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
