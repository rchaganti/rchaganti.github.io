      <description>&lt;p&gt;After I moved to a static site hosted on GitHub Pages, I was looking at different options to share the code snippets in a better way. With the Hugo generated static pages, there are a few options for code sharing in an article.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can use the simple pre-formatted text in markdown. This is usually done by enclosing code snippet in ```. This appears (in Hugo Coder theme I am using) as a big black block and has no way to choose the right syntax highlighting based on what programming language the snippet is written in. There are no line numbers or no highlighting of lines in a code snippet and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
