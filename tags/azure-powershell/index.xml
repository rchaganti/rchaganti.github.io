      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to speak at the inaugural edition of Experts Live India 2019 over the weekend. It was a great experience. The organizers did a great job even when there were teething facilities issues that plagued the event right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My first session was on Azure at the command line. In this session, I walked through both Az CLI 2.0 and Az PowerShell modules and explained the differences to help the audience choose the right tool for their job. The slides do not contain a huge deal of information as I preferred showing the audience a good demo to understand the differences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
