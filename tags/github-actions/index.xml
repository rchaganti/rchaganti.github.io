      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I moved to this site/blog to static pages using Hugo and GitHub pages, I have been finding ways to optimize the publishing experience. If you ever used Wordpress, the plugins that are available to customize the site look and feel and functionality will spoil you. They make your life easy by extending base functionality and you can achieve pretty much anything you want as long as there is a plugin for that and you will always find one. Moving from such an environment to a static page generator makes you feel that you have to do all the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
