<hr>
<p>When PowerShell 4.0 was first released, I had immediately jumped onto PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) feature and blogged about it quite a bit. Just when I thought I should turn that into an ebook, Apress approached for publishing a book around PowerShell DSC and I immediately said yes. It was fun writing this and like my previous books, this was an instant hit since there was not even proper documentation around PowerShell DSC at that time.</p>
<p>This book is available for purchase on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Windows-PowerShell-Desired-Configuration-Revealed-ebook/dp/B01JCK04UE/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Windows+PowerShell+Desired+State+Configuration+Revealed&amp;qid=1590239343&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon</a>.</p>
<h4 id="pro-powershell-desired-state-configuration">Pro PowerShell Desired State Configuration</h4>
<hr>
<p>After the first book on PowerShell DSC and after release of PowerShell 5.1, DSC added many new features and exciting enhancements. A lot of cloud providers added support for DSC as well. It was not very easy to cover everything in a single book. It took me exactly 2 years to finish writing this book but it was worth it. <em>Pro PowerShell Desired State Configuration</em> significantly expands previous edition, bringing a complete in-depth reference for applying this evolving technology in your day-to-day work involving PowerShell DSC.</p>

<p>This ebook is more like a beginner guide that will take you from zero to hero around the concepts of PowerShell remoting feature in version 2.0. This was my first attempt at writing anything more than a couple of pages. And, IMHO, this ebook (or rather just a PDF) was very well received and was the most referenced during the days of PowerShell 2.0 and 3.0. I really enjoyed writing it since I wrote it the way I prefer to read the remoting concepts and that clicked with many readers. I started it as a blog post series and converted that into a consolidated PDF format.</p>
<p>This is available for no cost <a href="https://ravichaganti.com/ebooks/AlaymansguidetoPowerShell2remotingv2.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>This ebook helps you explore basics of WMI Query Language, different types of WMI queries, and learn how PowerShell can be used to retrieve WMI management information using WQL. This is still the most popular WMI content out there referenced by many administrators and security (red and blue teams) professionals.</p>
